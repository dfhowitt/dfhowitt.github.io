            <p>Born in Tokyo, raised in London and educated at LSE, I have travelled and worked
            across the world. During my time at both HSBC and Commerzbank I developed strong
            analytical skills and became a finance associate at Qadre where I was responsible for
            financial reporting, analysis and modelling.
            </p>
            <p>
            I also led the research team and managed relationships with prospective clients
            to consult on and design tech solutions for companies in the trade finance, post-trade
            and corporate admin industries. After a year of working closely with the talented tech team
            I was ambitious to upskill and learn how to become a full stack web developer at Le Wagon.

          <div class="about-intro-right">
            <p>
            Before starting the bootcamp, I travelled coast-to-coast in Australia,
            through Southeast Asia and then lived in Tokyo where I studied N3
            level Japanese.
            <p>
            At Le Wagon I led our project team in launching
            a live web application which stimulated my appetite for design
            and end-to-end project management. Moreover,
            I enjoy problem solving and my mathematical competency and background in finance
            make me a strong backend engineer.
            Since then I have been working on freelance
            and personal projects in web development and data analytics.
            I am open to any opportunity so feel free to

                    I coordinated a large research project which involved gathering information
                    and analysing data to be included in the final report.
                    After completing the project I produced some of my own research on the relationship
                    between accounting practices and pension liabilities and wrote an
                    <a href="https://www.longfinance.net/news/pamphleteers/understanding-the-pension-crisis/", target="blank">article</a>
                    for the company’s blog.

                      I helped the investment team by gathering financial data and analysing
                      potential investments. I presented my research to the investment team regularly
                      and was involved in the structuring and execution of investments.

        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
